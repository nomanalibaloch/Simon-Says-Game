This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must replicate by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons. The sequence grows progressively harder with each round, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.

-------Technologies Used-------
HTML: For the structure of the game.
CSS: To style the buttons and create the flashing effect.
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, including sequence generation, user input, and level progression.
--------How to Play-------
Press any key to start the game.
Watch the sequence of color flashes.
Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
The sequence grows longer with each roundâ€”try to keep up!
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can start over by pressing any key.
