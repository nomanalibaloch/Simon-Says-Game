Description
This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must replicate by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons. The sequence grows progressively harder with each round, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.

How It Works
The game starts when the player presses any key.
A random color in the sequence is flashed on the screen. The player must click the buttons in the same order as shown.
After each round, a new color is added to the sequence, making it longer.
The game ends when the player clicks the wrong color, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
The player can restart the game by pressing any key after a game over.
Features
Random Color Generation: Each round, a new random color is added to the sequence.
Color Flashing: The colors flash to guide the player in the sequence to follow.
User Input Feedback: Each button flashes when clicked to give the player visual feedback.
Game Over Detection: The game checks the player's input against the sequence. If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends and shows their score.
Responsive Restart: After a game over, pressing any key will restart the game.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the game.
CSS: To style the buttons and create the flashing effect.
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, including sequence generation, user input, and level progression.
